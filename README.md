# NFTidenTity

NFidenTity is a user management system to securely manage and control user accounts in a public or company computer systems environment. 

Most commonly used in libraries, universities and in corporate offices, IT access software is all around us. Different settings have different methods of restricting user access to prevent them from making critical changes to the device or by allowing them to access relevant software only.

Often in each use case, there are multiple access layers that are granted across different mediums and platforms to the users of these systems. Security is the number one priority and the verification of identity is critical to enforce this. 

In a public computer system environment, users will login using a set of credentials that is granted to them via a subscription or similar. Often these credentials are used in multiple locations
